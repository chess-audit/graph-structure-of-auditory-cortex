### Figure 2 ###

Representative correlation matrices derived from generated artificial datasets. This figure shows matrices from two different datasets, in which the connectivity principles were random connectivity probability (left of Figure 2) and probability of connectivity based on the features of the neighbouring nodes (right of Figure 2). The number of nodes in these datasets is given by n, to show that the link prediction of the algorithm remains robust across a range of dataset sizes.
