a)	Representative connectivity matrix (that is neuronal correlation matrix) from real neuronal dataset. The sparsity of the connectivity matrix of the neuronal dataset is clearly visible here.
b)	Representative frequency tuning curves for neurons presented with a range of sounds at different frequencies. These frequency tuning curves can be used as the features of each respective neuron; that is, the response of the neuron at each of the presented frequencies (in this case, 20 distinct frequencies) is used as a feature of that neuron. GraphSage subsequently uses the features of each neuron (treated as a node in the graph) for link prediction.
