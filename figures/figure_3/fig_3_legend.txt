a)	Schematic of validation mechanism for link prediction with GraphSage-based algorithm. Multiple artificial connectivity matrices with known connectivity principles were generated and partitioned into training and test sets. The algorithm predicts links between nodes in a given generated matrix (represented here by a predicted connectivity matrix). The GraphSage-based algorithm is visually represented here by a schematic artificial neural network, with rectified linear (relu) activation functions in the embedding layers and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function in the prediction layer.
b)	Representative generated connectivity matrix. In this example, the connectivity principles of each node u in the matrix are dictated by the aggregated features of the neighbouring nodes as described in Methods. Other connectivity principles, such as random and non-linear connectivities, were additionally explored. The colour bar, scaled between [–1,1], can be interpreted as a representation of the correlation between the activity of neurons in the real neuronal dataset. Thus, performance of this link prediction algorithm on these generated connectivity matrices provides some validation of its utility in the context of the real neuronal dataset. 
c)	Mean performance of the link prediction algorithm on 10 simulations of generated connectivity matrices. Performance on true positive and true negative link predictions are shown, along with the f1 macro score (harmonic mean of the precision and recall of the algorithm). Error bars depict ± 2 S.E.M.
