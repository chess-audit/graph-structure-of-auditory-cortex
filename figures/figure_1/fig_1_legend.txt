a)	Overview
i)	Neighbourhood node sampling. To generate the embedding for each node in the graph, the GraphSage algorithm samples feature information from the neighbouring nodes (where ‘neighbouring’ is defined as having a direct connection to the specified node; in the case of neuronal population recordings, this means correlated activity). This occurs sequentially through increasing ‘search depths’, k, which can intuitively be interpreted as degrees of separation from the specified node. This sampling procedure implemented in this study, which is the novel algorithmic component of GraphSage, yields information about the features in the neighbourhood of each node.
ii)	Aggregation of feature information from neighbours. GraphSage uses a set of aggregator functions to iteratively aggregate information from the local neighbourhood of the given node. Intuitively, this can be interpreted as the node collecting incrementally more information from neighbouring nodes as the algorithm iterates through k search depths. Aggregators take the element-wise mean of the features of each of the neighbouring nodes, thereby generating an embedding for the specified node.
iii)	Prediction of node features and links using aggregated information. The resulting embeddings generated can be used for link prediction, classification, and community detection in the graph.
b)	Schematic representation of the embedding function of the algorithm. The embedding function (f) converts the features of each node in the graph (u ∈ U) together with the features of the neighbouring nodes into a vector representation composed of real numbers. Subsequently, these vector representations of each node (which are, thus, vector representations of the neurons) can be used for link prediction, classification, and community detection.
